This is a Python library for parsing NMEA data into usable objects.

The idea of this project is to provide a general purpose approach to parsing NMEA data. Most other python libraries that deal with the data seem geared towards GPS only, leaving little room for developers to extend the library to their own needs. This project attempts to fill this gap.

Version 0.6.0 is the current release. Versions prior to this will not include some NMEA sentences.

Currently not all sentences are implemented but the intention is to do so. Please check back often as more will be added.

Requests for specific sentences to be prioritised are welcome. Just open up a new issue with your request!

You can also install using pip:
pip install pynmea
